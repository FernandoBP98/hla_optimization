# Modeling and Optimization of Management Problems

## Overview

This project covers the contents studied in the subject "Modeling and Optimization of Management Programs" of the Master's Degree in Industrial Engineering of the University of Seville.

These files present the implementation of Hub Location Allocation (HLA) optimization problem. For this purpose, the following optimization algorithms will be studied:

* Bruteforce (BF)
* Cost Saving (CS)
* Local Search (LS)
* Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) and Descendant (VND)
* Simulated Annealing (SA)
* Tabu Search (TS)
